 Project Overview 

This project implements a configurable image processingsystem using Verilog HDL, capable of performing multiple image processing operations on grayscale images.
The design supports Grayscale conversion, Image Inversion, Blurring, and Edge Detection, selectable through a control signal. The system is designed for pixel-level
and kernel-level processing, making it suitable for FPGA-based image processing applications.

Architecture & Working 

The design is implemented as a single integrated Verilog module containing multiple image processing blocks. Based on the selected mode, only the corresponding processing logic is activated, while other operations
remain idle.
Pixel-wise operations such as grayscale conversion and inversion operate on individual pixels, while kernel-based operations such as blurring and edge detection use neighborhood-based computations. Input images are
provided in HEX format, enabling direct compatibility with Verilog simulation and hardware workflows.

Verification Methodology 

The image processing module was verified using functional simulation and output image analysis.
Individual image processing modes (Grayscale, Inversion, Blurring, and Edge Detection) were selected using a control signal and tested independently. For each mode, input images were converted from JPEG to HEX using
Python and fed to the Verilog design through a testbench.
Simulation waveforms were analyzed in ModelSim/Vivado to verify correct pixel-level and kernel-level behavior. The processed HEX output generated by the Verilog module was then converted back to JPEG using Python,
and the resulting images were visually inspected for correctness.
Waveforms and corresponding output images for all supported operations are included in the repository. This verification approach confirms both the functional correctness of the RTL design and the end-to-end
hardware–software workflow.
